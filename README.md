# Spotify-Match
I began developing this project as a spin-off of my group's main project at VandyHacks2019. The concept is simple: copy 2 spotify user share links into the input boxes, then graphs of each user's top 5 genres and a percent differents will appear on the reselts page. Right now the project does not have much real use, it is more novelty then anything else, but my hope is to eventually turn it into a public API that could possibly be integrated into reccommender systems. For example, the API data could be used to create a website that can direct people to downtown music venues that were liked by people holding similar music interests. Until then, it will just remain a fun way to compare your music preferences with your friends.
